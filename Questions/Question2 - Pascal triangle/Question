Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:


Example 1:

Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
Example 2:

Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]


Hint: Value of current rows R and col C =  R-1 
                                              C
                                               C-1

For Eg: value of 5th row 3rd col is 4c2 ie 6.
